One more analysis page needed for non-station traders.
You have already huge amount of market data of sell and buy orders and volume(in cargo bay) of product is also known fact.

From these numbers you can already calculate what are most profitable products to buy and sell. Without just browsing throught all products. 

User interface would have "just" next inputs.
-Ships cargo capacity
-Number of jumps
-Enable/disable low/0.0 sec

And i guess it's possible to do analysis what are best products currently to make profits. Just as a trade. 

As an result i would get best profitable deals as buyer and seller of product depending what is my cargo capacity.
